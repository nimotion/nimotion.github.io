# What is an integrated motor?

Integrated drive control motors, with their high level of integration, compatibility, convenience, and excellent performance, have become a shining star in modern industrial automation. They are undoubtedly an ideal choice for users seeking efficient, precise, and intelligent control.

## The core definition of integrated motor

As the name suggests, an integrated motor is a servo system that integrates components such as a motor, encoder, and driver. It can support buses such as EtherCAT, CANopen, and Modbus.

Simply put, it's like the difference between a desktop computer and a laptop.

Therefore, their compact size easily evokes the need for complex configurations like a driver, encoder, and brake (some products have built-in brakes). They are particularly suitable for space-sensitive and distributed control applications.

According to the International Electrotechnical Commission ([IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission)) standards, its typical characteristics include:

- **Modular design:** The motor body shares a common housing with the inverter, encoder and other components, reducing external wiring
- **Intelligent control:** built-in PLC or IoT interface, supporting real-time parameter adjustment(IEEE 2025 Smart Motor Technology White Paper)
